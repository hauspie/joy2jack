# And the button mapping
# The syntax is: event(parameters...) -> action(parameters...)
# events can be:
#  - pressed:  the value is a button number. The action is triggered on a button pressed
#  - released: the value is a button number. The action is triggered when a button is released
#  - pushed: the value is a button number. A shortcut for defining an
#    action that can be triggered when a button is pressed AND when a
#    button is released. Only some actions can be used with pushed
#    (see actions).
# actions can be:
#  - noteon: send a noteon midi command. This action takes one, two of
#    three parameters. The first parameter must be a note number. The
#    second one is optional an is the velocity of the note (between 1
#    and 127). If not given, the velocity is set to DEFAULT_VELOCITY
#    if defined in the config file or a value of 100. The third one,
#    optional, is the midi channel to send note to (between 1 and
#    16). If not given, DEFAULT_MIDI_CHANNEL is used if defined in the
#    config file or a value of 1 otherwise.
#  - noteoff: send a noteoff midi command. One parameter is allowed, the note number
#  - note: smart action that handles noteon and noteoff depending on
#    if the button is pressed or released. If the event is "pressed",
#    send a noteon. If "released", send a noteoff. If the event is
#    pushed, a noteon is sent when the button is pressed AND a noteoff
#    is sent when the button is released.

# The button number and the note can either be a integer value or a
# previously defined symbol.
# Theses mapping sends only noteon at default velocity
